# GeoML-Lab
GeoML is a repository dedicated to exploring and advancing machine learning applications in Earth observation.
This lab serves as a collection of projects, tutorials, and experiments focused on processing multi-spectral and 
multi-temporal remote sensing data using state-of-the-art deep learning techniques. From building basic autoencoders 
for grayscale imagery to developing sophisticated convolutional and 3D autoencoders for multi-channel, time-series data, 
GeoML-Lab aims to empower researchers and practitioners to unlock the full potential of Earth observation in environmental 
monitoring, land cover classification, and beyond. Contributions and collaborations are warmly welcomed!
