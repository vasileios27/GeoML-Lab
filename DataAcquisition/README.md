# ERA5 Data Acquisition Script

This script automates the retrieval of hourly ERA5 reanalysis data on single levels from the Copernicus Climate Data Store (CDS) using the `cdsapi` Python package.

## ‚úÖ What It Does

- Downloads hourly reanalysis data for selected meteorological variables.
- Covers a user-defined range of years (currently 1970 to 2023).
- Retrieves data at four synoptic hours: 00:00, 06:00, 12:00, and 18:00 UTC.
- Saves data as compressed NetCDF files (`.nc.zip`), one per year and variable.

## üì¶ Requirements

- Python 3
- `cdsapi` package
- Valid CDS API key configured at `~/.cdsapirc` ([CDS API instructions](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api-how-to))

Install `cdsapi` via pip:
```bash
pip install cdsapi
````

## üîß How to Use

1. Modify the following parameters in the script as needed:

   * `directory_path`: where to save downloaded files.
   * `years`: start and end year (e.g., `[1970, 2023]`).
   * `variables`: list of ERA5 variables to retrieve (e.g., `"10m_u_component_of_wind"`).

2. Run the script:

```bash
python download_era5_single_levels.py
```

Each file will be named like:

```
10m_u_component_of_wind_Y1980.nc.zip
```

## üìå Notes

* Dataset used: `reanalysis-era5-single-levels`
* Data is retrieved at daily frequency with 4 time steps.
* All months and days are included.

To add or remove variables, edit the `variables` list in the script.

## üßæ Request Format
The code works based on the request, which is constructed in the code. For example 
```bash
request = {
    "product_type": ["reanalysis"],
    "variable": variable,
    "year": year,
    "month": [ "01", ..., "12"],
    "day": [ "01", ..., "31"],
    "time": ["00:00", "06:00", "12:00", "18:00"],
    "data_format": "netcdf",
    "download_format": "zip",
}
```
 * "product_type": always set to "reanalysis" for ERA5 historical data.
 * "time": specifies the hourly timestamps to download. ERA5 provides hourly data (00:00 to 23:00), but this script downloads 4 synoptic times (00:00, 06:00, 12:00, 18:00) commonly used in meteorology.
 * "data_format": format of the output file. Options include:
 * "netcdf": easier to read with scientific tools and Python libraries.
 * "grib": more compact, typically used in numerical weather prediction models.
 * "download_format": downloads the file as a .zip archive.
   
  üåç Optional: Geographical Subsetting
  To restrict the download to a specific geographic area, add the area key to the request dictionary:
```bash
"area": [90, -180, -90, 180],  # Format: [North, West, South, East]
```
For example, to download data only over Europe, the request should have the format 
```bash
request = {
    "product_type": ["reanalysis"],
    "variable": variable,
    "year": year,
    "month": [ "01", ..., "12"],
    "day": [ "01", ..., "31"],
    "time": ["00:00", "06:00", "12:00", "18:00"],
    "data_format": "netcdf",
    "download_format": "zip",
    "area": [72, -25, 34, 45]
}
```
