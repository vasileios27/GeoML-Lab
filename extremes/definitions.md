# ⚡ Extreme Event Definitions and Examples

*Part of the GeoML-Lab Multi-Model Framework for Extreme Weather Forecasting*

---

## 🌍 Purpose

This document describes **how GeoML-Lab defines and identifies extreme events** in weather and climate data.
These definitions form the foundation for:

* **Labeling events** used in model training and evaluation
* **Establishing thresholds** for classification and regression tasks
* **Comparing AI model performance** on rare, high-impact phenomena

---

## 📈 General Definition

An **extreme event** is defined as an atmospheric or hydrological phenomenon that **significantly deviates from the local climatological distribution**, typically beyond a specified percentile threshold.
In most analyses, GeoML-Lab adopts:

* **Upper-tail extremes:** 95th–99th percentile (e.g., heavy rain, heatwaves, high wind)
* **Lower-tail extremes:** 1st–5th percentile (e.g., cold spells, low pressure anomalies)

All thresholds are computed over a **30-year reference climatology (e.g., 1991–2020)** using **ERA5 reanalysis** or compatible datasets.

## 🌧️ Categories of Extreme Events

| Type                      | Definition                                                    | Typical Threshold                                 | Relevant Variables   | ERA5 Codes    |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- | ------------- |
| **Extreme Precipitation** | Daily or hourly rainfall exceeding local 95th–99th percentile | >95th percentile of total precipitation (`tp`)    | `tp`, `cape`, `tcwv` | 228, 59       |
| **Heatwaves**             | ≥3 consecutive days above 90th percentile of max temperature  | 90th percentile of `t2m` or `tmax`                | `t2m`, `tmax`, `rh`  | 167, 201      |
| **Cold Spells**           | ≥3 consecutive days below 10th percentile of min temperature  | 10th percentile of `t2m` or `tmin`                | `t2m`, `tmin`        | 202           |
| **Wind Extremes**         | 10-m wind speed above 95th percentile                         | >95th percentile of `u10`, `v10`                  | `u10`, `v10`, `ws10` | 165, 166      |
| **Storms / Cyclones**     | Closed low-pressure systems with extreme wind/rain signatures | <5th percentile of sea-level pressure + high wind | `msl`, `u10`, `v10`  | 151, 165, 166 |
| **Compound Events**       | Simultaneous or sequential extremes (e.g., rain + wind)       | Joint exceedance of multiple variables            | Combined             | —             |

## 🧮 Example: ERA5 Threshold Computation

The following example computes the **95th percentile rainfall threshold** for a location or grid cell:

```python
import xarray as xr
import numpy as np

ds = xr.open_dataset("ERA5_precip_1991_2020.nc")
tp = ds["tp"] * 1000  # convert to mm

threshold = tp.quantile(0.95, dim="time")
threshold.to_netcdf("precip_95th_threshold.nc")
```

To classify an extreme event:

```python
extreme_event = (tp > threshold)
```

---

## 🧠 Notes on Labeling for Machine Learning

* Events are **binary-labeled** as 1 (extreme) or 0 (non-extreme).
* Compound events may use **multi-label encoding** (e.g., `[rain, wind] = [1,1]`).
* For probabilistic models, labels are used to compute **Brier** and **ROC** scores.
* ERA5 grid-level thresholds are saved under `/data/thresholds/` for model input pipelines.

## 📚 Regional Considerations

Thresholds may vary depending on climatic regions:

* **Northern Europe:** High wind and storm events dominate; use 95th wind percentile.
* **Mediterranean Basin:** Short-duration convective extremes; use 99th rainfall percentile.
* **Tropical zones:** Daily rainfall thresholds may be replaced by 3-hourly accumulation.

## 🧩 Integration Notes

The thresholds and event masks defined here will be directly used in:

* **Model evaluation scripts** (`evaluation.ipynb`)
* **Training pipelines** for binary or probabilistic classification of extremes
* **Visualization dashboards** showing detected events versus observations

Would you like me to now generate a **simple diagram (`extreme_event_thresholds.png`)** that visually explains how ERA5 data → percentile threshold → extreme classification works (for inclusion under `/extremes/images/`)?
